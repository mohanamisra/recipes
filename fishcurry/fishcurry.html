    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is macher jhol or Bengali fish curry which is a classic Bengali fish stew. This recipe uses mustard (both oil and spice) for a unique flavour.</p>
    <p>It is a delightfully tasty, runny fish curry that goes really well with boiled rice.</p>
    <p>Many failed experiments, and I’ve finally come up with a recipe that tastes pretty good. Thanks to a Bengali friend who gave me inputs to which I added my own tweaks. So here you go:</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb. Rohu fish fillets</li>
        <li>2 onions</li>
        <li>2 tsp. ginger paste</li>
        <li>1 tsp. garlic paste</li>
        <li>2 tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 tsp. mustard paste</li>
        <li>3 tbsp. Mustard oil</li>
        <li>2 tsp. mustard oil</li>
        <li>1 tsp. mustard seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp. Nigella seeds</li>
        <li>1 tsp. cayenne</li>
        <li>1 tsp. coriander powder</li>
        <li>2 tsp. turmeric powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp. garam masala</li>
        <li>1 tsp. lemon juice        </li>
        <li>4-5 green chillies        </li>
        <li>chopped cilantro</li>
        <li>Salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, clean the fish and marinate it with 1 tsp. turmeric powder and salt and keep aside for 15 minutes.        </li>
        <li>Heat 2 tbsp. of mustard oil in a skillet and cook the fish fillets till they are golden brown on both sides for about 2 minutes each side. They don't need to be fully cooked just browned. Keep aside.        </li>
        <li>Preheat Air fryer at 200 C or 390 F for 3 minutes. Brush the air fryer basket with mustard oil. Also brush the fish fillets with oil on both sides.        </li>
        <li>Lay them down in the air fryer basket in a single layer. Air fry for 4 minutes till they are ⅔ cooked and look browned. Take out and keep aside.        </li>
        <li>To make the gravy, take the remaining mustard oil in the same pan. Heat it and add mustard seeds and kalonji or nigella seeds. Allow them to sputter for 30 seconds.        </li>
        <li>Add in the onion paste, sliced green chillies and ginger-garlic paste and cook till everything is browned. This takes about 5-8 minutes on low heat.        </li>
        <li>Add tomato paste along with spices -- cayenne, coriander powder, garam masala (if using) and salt. Cook for about 5 minutes on low flame to assimilate everything.        </li>
        <li>Add in a cup of water and the fried fish pieces. Cover and cook for about 3-4 minutes.        </li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasoning. Garnish with lemon juice, coriander leaves and serve hot with boiled rice.        </li>
    </ol>
