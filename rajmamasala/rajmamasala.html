    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This Rajma recipe is a lightly spiced, creamy and delicious Punjabi style curry made with protein rich kidney beans, aromatics like onions, ginger, garlic, fragrant spices and tangy tomatoes. My Mom’s recipe for restaurant-style Punjabi Rajma Masala is a staple in our home, and after you try it I’ll bet it becomes one at yours, too. I also share a homestyle one pot Rajma Masala (which many of our readers had requested) that will remind you about the comforting and satisfying Rajma Curry (or Rajma Chawal) made in Punjabi homes.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup kidney beans) – about 200 grams rajma, soaked overnight in enough water        </li>
        <li>2.5 cups water for pressure cooking        </li>
        <li>½ to 1 teaspoon chopped green chillies or 1 green chili, chopped        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped garlic or 7 to 8 medium-sized garlic        </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped ginger or 2 inches chopped ginger        </li>
        <li>3 medium tomatoes, chopped – about 200 grams        </li>
        <li>1 large onion, chopped – about 100 grams        </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon turmeric powder        </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon red chili powder or cayenne pepper        </li>
        <li>¾ to 1 teaspoon Garam Masala Powder        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dry mango powder (amchur powder)        </li>
        <li>1 teaspoon cumin seeds        </li>
        <li>2 tablespoon butter or oil        </li>
        <li>salt as required        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Soak 1 cup (200 grams) kidney beans in enough water overnight or for 8 to 9 hours.        </li>
        <li>The next day or after 8 to 9 hours, drain the soaked water.        </li>
        <li>Rinse the kidney beans again in fresh clean water.        </li>
        <li>Drain all the water and set the beans aside.        </li>
        <li>Finely chop the veggies – 1 large onion (100 gms), 3 medium tomatoes (200 gms), 1 inch ginger, 7 to 8 medium sized garlic and 1 green chilli. Keep aside.</li>
        <li>In a 3 litre stovetop pressure cooker add the kidney beans together with the chopped onions, tomatoes, ginger, garlic and green chilies.        </li>
        <li>Now add the spices – 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, ½ teaspoon red chili powder, ½ teaspoon turmeric powder and salt as per taste.        </li>
        <li>Pour 2.5 cups water.        </li>
        <li>Stir and mix very well.</li>
        <li>Add 2 tablespoons butter or oil.        </li>
        <li>Stir again.</li>
        <li>Cover pressure cooker tightly with its lid. Pressure cook for 18 to 20 whistles or about 20 to 22 minutes on medium-high to high heat.        </li>
        <li>Once the pressure settles down on its own, open the lid and check the beans. The kidney beans have to be soft and cooked completely.

            Taste a few beans and they should be melt in the mouth without giving you any bite or resistance while eating.
            
            If the beans are still not cooked completely, then add about ½ cup more of water and pressure cook again for 5 to 6 whistles or as needed.</li>
        <li>Once the kidney beans have softened and are cooked well, then check the consistency of the gravy or curry.        </li>
        <li>Keep the cooker on the stovetop without lid and on a medium-low to medium heat simmer the gravy.        </li>
        <li>Add about ¾ to 1 teaspoon of garam masala powder.        </li>
        <li>Mix well and simmer till the gravy consistency thickens. Mash a few kidney beans with the back of a spoon to thicken the consistency.

            If while cooking the water reduces too much and the consistency becomes very thick, then add some hot water and stir to combine</li>
        <li>When the consistency of the gravy is no longer broth-like or water-like and thickened somewhat like the one shown in the photo below, then the rajma gravy is ready. If you want you can thicken the gravy more, if having with chapati or roti.

            But if eating rajma masala with rice then there is no need to thicken the gravy. Lastly check the taste and add more of salt, garam masala, or dry mango powder if required. You can even garnish rajma curry with some coriander leaves.</li>
