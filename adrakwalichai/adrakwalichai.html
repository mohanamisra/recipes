    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Black Tea Leaves</li>
            <li>Ginger</li>
            <li>Cardamom</li>
            <li>Sweetener</li>
            <li>Milk</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Thinly slice a 1-inch knob of ginger into chunks or matchsticks. I prefer to peel it first, but you can also give it a rinse and scrub any dirt off. A 1-inch knob is enough for two cups of water. Additionally, crush the cardamom just a bit to crack open and expose the seeds inside.</li>
            <li>Bring water up to a simmer in a saucepan, then add the ginger and cardamom. Allow the water to come to a boil for 2-3 minutes, the hue of the water will be a mild yellow-ish color. Then, add the black tea. Loose leaf or tea bags work! Add 1 teaspoon or 1 tea bag per cup of water.</li>
            <li>Steep the black tea for 3-5 minutes. The tea should be really dark red hue but be careful not to over-boil otherwise the tea will be bitter.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and add about Â¼ cup of milk, or as much milk until you get your preferred milkiness of tea. If you're using a plant-based milk, you may want to warm it separately (like in the microwave) and mix it in after removing the tea from heat to prevent separation or curdling.</li>
            <li>Pour the tea through a fine mesh sieve into a tea pot or into individual mugs or cutting chai cups.
            </li>
            <li>Mix in honey, sugar, or you're preferred sweetener to the tea when serving.</li>
        </ol>
