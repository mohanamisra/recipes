    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Shoyu ramen is a ramen noodle dish flavored with shoyu, the Japanese word for soy sauce. Shoyu is one of four types of tare (seasoning) used to flavor ramen broth in Japan—the other three are shio ramen (salt ramen), miso ramen (fermented soybean paste ramen), and tonkotsu ramen, made with pork bone broth.</p>
    <p>Japanese ramen starts with a soup base made from chicken or pork bones, seafood, or dashi, and the tare is typically added later so that one stock can yield multiple flavors. This also allows the chefs at ramen shops to control the seasoning for each bowl of ramen.    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 piece kombu (kelp)</li>
        <li>½ cup katsuobushi (bonito flakes)</li>
        <li>2 cups homemade chicken stock or low-sodium chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, finely grated</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons grated ginger</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons shoyu (Japanese soy sauce)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mirin</li>
        <li>10 ounces fresh ramen noodles (or 6 ounces dried noodles)</li>
        <li>2 pieces of menma (fermented bamboo shoots)</li>
        <li>4 slices chashu (pork shoulder or belly simmered in soy sauce and mirin)</li>
        <li>6 slices of narutomaki (fish cakes)</li>
        <li>2 pieces of nori</li>
        <li>1 soft boiled egg, halved</li>
        <li>2 scallions, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sesame seeds, coarsely ground</li>
        <li>Shichimi togarashi or chili oil, to serve (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Make the dashi. In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring kombu and 2 cups of water to a simmer.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and take out the kombu.</li>
        <li>Return the pot to the heat and add the katsuobushi.</li>
        <li>Bring to a simmer, then remove from the heat and set aside, covered, for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Using a fine-mesh strainer, strain out the liquid. This is your dashi stock.</li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, combine dashi stock and chicken stock over low heat to keep warm.</li>
        <li>Make the shoyu tare. In a small skillet over medium-high heat, heat sesame oil until shimmering.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and ginger and sauté until fragrant, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>Add the soy sauce and mirin and remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>Add the shoyu tare to the dashi chicken stock one spoonful at a time until it tastes well seasoned.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat. Cook the ramen noodles in boiling water according to package directions. When the noodles are al dente, remove the noodles from the water and drain well.</li>
        <li>Divide noodles over two bowls and ladle the soup base over the noodles.</li>
        <li>Top the bowls with menma, chashu, and narutomaki.</li>
        <li>Place the nori sheet in between the egg half and the side of the bowl.</li>
        <li>Garnish with green onions, sesame oil, and shichimi togarashi or chili oil, if using.</li>
    </ul>
